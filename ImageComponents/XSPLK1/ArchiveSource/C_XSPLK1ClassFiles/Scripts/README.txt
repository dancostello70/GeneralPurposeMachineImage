To run the logmaker script, simply launch the command file named "StartLogMaker".

These scripts are written based on the assumption that:

1. The contents of the github repository at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Splunk-7-Essentials-Third-Edition have been downloaded
   and extracted to a folder at C:\splunk-essentials-master\
2. The other files for the Splunk Fundamentals Level 1 class have been extracted to a folder at C:\XSPLK1ClassFiles

If you are using different paths, please edit the LogMaker.ps1 file in the current directory. There are two variables right at the
top of the script that can be edited to specify your alternate paths.
